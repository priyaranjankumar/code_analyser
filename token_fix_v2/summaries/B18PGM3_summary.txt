Based on the information provided, it seems that there is no actual program present in this codebase, only three variables. Without a program, the codebase does not accomplish any specific task or function. It's like having ingredients for a recipe but no instructions on how to combine them. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the overall purpose of the codebase at this point.

Since there are no programs in the codebase, there are no key components to discuss in terms of their roles. The three variables could potentially be used in a variety of ways, but without a program to provide context, it's impossible to determine their intended use. 

In terms of architecture, the codebase is extremely minimalistic. With only three variables and no programs, there is no high-level structure or organization to speak of. It's like having a building site with materials but no blueprint. Without additional information or context, it's impossible to provide a more detailed analysis of the codebase.
